    "## 2. Deploy Azure resources with Bicep\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will deploy all the necessary Azure resources, previously listed, using [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment occurs at the subscription level, creating a new resource group. The location of the deployment is set to **West Europe** and this can be changed, as well as other parameters, in the [`./infra/main.bicepparam`](./infra/main.bicepparam) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** To run this deployment successfully, you must provide a value for the `apiManagementPublisherEmail` and `apiManagementPublisherName` parameters in the [`./infra/main.bicepparam`](./infra/main.bicepparam) file. These values are used to configure the Azure API Management instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may take up to 10 minutes due to the Azure API Management resource needing to be activated successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managed Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "A [user-assigned Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) is created for the Azure API Management instance. This is used to authenticate with the Azure Key Vault instance to retrieve the API Keys for the Azure OpenAI Service instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "An [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) instance is created to store the API Keys for the deployed Azure OpenAI Service instances. The API Keys are stored as [secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets) in the Key Vault instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Two [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai-service/overview) instances are deployed, one in the West Europe region and one in the East US region. These are deployed with the `gpt-35-turbo` models to be used for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Management - Backends\n",
    "\n",
    "[API Management backends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/backends?tabs=bicep) are created for each deployed Azure OpenAI Service instance. Each backend points to the endpoint of the deployed Azure OpenAI Service instances so that we can use them in conjunction with the deployed API Management API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Management - API\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure OpenAI Service has a standard REST API specification that we can use to import the API into API Management. You can [find the latest OpenAPI specifications in the Azure REST API specifications GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/cognitiveservices/data-plane/AzureOpenAI/inference/preview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is configured on the `/openai` path for the deployed Azure API Management instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Management - Subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access the API, we need to [create a subscription for it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions). This will generate a subscription key that we can use to make requests to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Management - Named Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the deployed Azure OpenAI Service instances, [API Management Named Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties?tabs=azure-portal) are created for each API Key that was stored in Azure Key Vault as part of the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create these so that we can use them in the API Management policies when making requests to the Azure OpenAI Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Management - Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "With everything configured in Azure API Management to take advantage of the multiple Azure OpenAI Service instances, we [deploy a policy to the API Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-policies) to load balance requests across the backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [API Management OpenAI policy](./infra/policies/round-robin-policy.xml) defines a round-robin load balancing strategy based on the following flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On an inbound request, we check a cached `backend-counter` variable to determine which backend to use. If this doesn't exist, we create it and immediately set it to `0`.\n",
    "- We then use the `backend-counter` variable to set the backend service to use for the request, as well as the required `api-key` header to use for the request to the Azure OpenAI Service.\n",
    "- We then change the `backend-counter` to `1` and set it back to the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When processing the request at the backend, we provide a retry policy to handle any transient errors that may occur. This is to ensure that we don't lose any requests to the Azure OpenAI Service, and can swap to another backend if the current one is unavailable.\n",
    "- The process follows the same logic as the inbound request, whereby we check the cached `backend-counter` variable to determine which backend to use and set the `api-key` header accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [retry policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/retry-policy) for the backend will only trigger if the status code of the response is `400` or greater, and will retry up to 3 times with a 5 second delay between each retry. If the first request immediately fails, the retry policy will ensure that the request is immediately refired to another backend."
